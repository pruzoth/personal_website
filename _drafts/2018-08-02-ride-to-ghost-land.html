#K2K a.k.a Kashmir to Kanyakumari is a destination that every Indian rider longstanding dream. For some it's still a dream because of various reasons. I must say that now-a-days Indian adventurers has gone beyond limitation set by #K2K.

This article is about a ride of 950+ km in the state of Tamil Nadu. Actually from Bangalore to Dhanushkodi, whcih border with Srilanka diveded by palk strait. Actually we planned to ride with 2 bike but end-up with poovizhi's 1973 model classic 350 empowered with front disc, self-start and up-straight handle bar. The sad part, he's drink too lot and fuel efficiency came around 22kmpl with speed maintained with 80-90kmpl. We took our bikes from poovizhi's home</p>

We had lunch at Bodhidharma Yoga Centre. A nice place where monks preaches buddhist philosophy and teaches yoga in scheduled. It's also accomodating people for 2 weeks to learn yoga. It's remote place, lies between the Dindigal - Madurai Highway. A small waterfall is added beauty to this place. </p>
