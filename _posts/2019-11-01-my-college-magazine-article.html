Hi there! Myself Purushothaman Pachiappan, Pursuing 2nd year Master Degree in Computer Science & Engineering at our Institution.

Before you read this article I ask you a simple objective question.
<br><br>
May I?
<br>

Do you think your Gmail or Facebook Account is protected against Security?
The Answer is No! Absolutely not!
Recent Controversial News about Edward Snowden confirms you how spy agencies defeat privacy safeguards.
<b>Edward Snowden</b>,a  Former CIA agent & NSA contractor in USA has leaked threats about Internet users privacy. 
Today citizens of every countries are facing <b>“Privacy Problems”</b>. It’s a big threat in IT world. Organizations such as <b>NSA(National Security Agency)</b> of United States of America and GCHQ(Government Communication Headquarters) of United Kingdom are snooping and spoofing each and every people around the world. This is totally immoral to our Justice. Isn’t it? Anyhow I’m not a social activist to express a concern that the system could leads to violation against individuals liberty.
Since earlier days, our country is conquered by many invader through geographical areas, Now they are invading through IT. Our Government’s Confidential message are getting spoofed by American Agencies. Still we are unable to defend this type of attacks. This is shame for our Nation. But we people proudly call ourselves as largest IT Services in this planet. However , India successfully installed a cladestine mass electronic surveilance program by the <b>Centre for Development of Telematics(C-DOT)</b>. But it failed to crack into into Google and Skype servers. Our Nation is lacking in Network Security Aspirants. Our Government is spending too much money on these project. Its great scope for our students if you are very well in Cryptography.
Its time to defend against <b>E-WAR</b>.  Its not too late. Its time to made acronym of  INDIA as a <b>“Intelligent Detection Intrusion Attacks”</b>.  
As a Senior student of this institutions I requesting my juniors to be innovative in your studies and do project on “Network Security” to overcome these drawbacks and make our Nation Proud.
Jai Hind.
