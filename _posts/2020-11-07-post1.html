<p style="text-align:justify"><b>As we all know WhatsApp is an instant messanger that we use on daily basis to communicate among our friends, family and even for business purposes either via text, voice or Videocall. On Nov 5th 2020, NPCI has given approval to WhatsApp Pay to operate its UPI Payments service in India. As per news reports, WhatsApp pay is now available upto maximum of only 1 lakh registered users. However, NPCI has permitted WhatsApp Pay to offer its services to 2 crores registered users initially and is expected to expand in graded manner. </b></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b>WhatsApp is similiar to other UPI Payments apps such as GPay, PhonePe and Amazon Pay while BHIM (Bharat Interface for Money) is an app develeped by NPCI.</b></p>
