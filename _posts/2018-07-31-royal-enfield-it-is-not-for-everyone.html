For a Comman man, <b>Old Enfield Bullet</b> is just a rusty metal along with boring old analog odometer. Most modern bike rider might not be aware of idea of ampmeter placed in old bullet i.e.<b> Cast Iron Engine </b> and it's kick start technique which is quite challenging and it's weight which makes potholes everywhere you land it. But Still, there are people who are crazy about<b> Royal Enfield</b> for their legacy it carries for decades!. Even though young riders prefer bullet over modern bikes in pan India, but the likes are highly concentrated in <b>Punjab, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.</b>

    text-justify: inter-word;"><p>
<h3><b><u>1. It's a Rare Machine</u></b></h3>
</p>
<p>Yes, Bullet 346 cc Cast Iron Engine production is history now. Production has been moved from CI Engine to AVL and in late 2009, new Unit Construction Enigne has been introduced. Even though, UCE is better in efficient and comparatively more power, there are people who still look after Old CI engine. It's vintage look and unique Registration number Plate are main factor which bring odd in the croud.</p>

<h3><b><u>2. Pseudo Neutral</u></b></h3>
</p>
<p>Many bikers are not aware that the bullet has 2 neutral. Except bullet all other bikes has only standard neutral but enfield comes with pseudo neutral<b> a.k.a False Neutral</b>. False neutral is sit between 3th and 4th gear. Bullet also empowered with seperate neutral lever and it comes handy when you downshiting the gear. </p>

<div style="text-align: justify;
    text-justify: inter-word;"><p>
<h3><b><u>3. It's all about Thump</u></b></h3>
</p>
<p><b>Thump</b> - The only characteristcs where no other bikes can claim. Once you ride an enfield, you will never let her go. It's an awesome feeling only enfield users can enjoy. It attracts enough attention in the street and that's what the every riders could dream of</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;
    text-justify: inter-word;"><p>
<h3><b><u>4. Positioning of Brake and Gear</u></b></h3>
</p>
<p>If you are riding an Enfield for first time, you will have diffculty in gear shifting as it has misplaced the positioning of Rear Brake and Gear shifter. Once you are familiar with it, you are good to go. But always be aware of the misplacement and make use of false neutral in tough situation esp. bump to bump city traffic.</p>

<h3><b><u>5. Bucephalus</u></b></h3>
</p>
<p>Enfield Bullet is slightly higher than modern bikes which gives rider to feel <b>Equestrianism</b> along with thump. Some bulletter gives them a tag <b>Metal Horse</b>. Right from the Greek Alexander to French Napolean, Paurava Purushothamma to Chola Arunmozhi Varma, all of them are much concerned about their vahan and esp. Alexander found his bucephalus very rebellous in initial days and once he could control it, he made a history. The thought remain the same for modern men.</p>
